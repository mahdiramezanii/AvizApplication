### Image Size Adjustment

For image size adjustment, you can use HTML tags within Markdown:

```markdown
<img src="images/welcome_screen.png" width="300"/>
<img src="images/login_screen.png" width="300"/>
<img src="images/registration_screen.png" width="300"/>
<img src="images/profile_screen.png" width="300"/>
<img src="images/home_screen.png" width="300"/>
<img src="images/ad_details_screen.png" width="300"/>
<img src="images/search_screen.png" width="300"/>
<img src="images/ads_list_screen.png" width="300"/>
<img src="images/add_ad_screen.png" width="300"/>
```

This will help to keep the images aligned and properly sized within the README file. You can adjust the `width` attribute to fit your layout preferences.
